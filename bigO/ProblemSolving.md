Understand the Problem(twoSum.js)
1. Can i restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough info to solve the problem?
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are
a part of the problem?

Exploring Examples(countChar.js)
1. Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better
    -Start with simple examples
    -progress to more complex examples
    -explore examples with empty inputs
    -explore examples with invalid inputs
2. Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should

Break It Down(countChar.js)
1. Explicitly write out the steps you need to take

Solve/Simplify
1. Find the core difficulty in what you are trying to do
2. Temporarily ignore that difficulty
3. Write a simplified solution
4. Then incorporate that difficulty back in

Lookback/Refactor
1. Can you check the results?
2. Can you derive the result differently?
3. Can yoy understand it at a glance?
4. Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
5. Can you improve the performance of the solution?
6. Think of other ways to refactor?
7. How have other people solved this problem?
